A fast plotting library built using the [`pygfx`](https://github.com/pygfx/pygfx) render engine utilizing [Vulkan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan), [DX12](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX#DirectX_12), or [Metal](https://developer.apple.com/metal/) via WGPU, so it is very fast! We also aim to be an expressive plotting library that enables rapid prototyping for large scale explorative scientific visualization.

# Supported frameworks

`fastplotlib` can run on anything that [`pygfx`](https://github.com/pygfx/pygfx) can also run, this includes:

:heavy_check_mark: `Jupyter lab`, using [`jupyter_rfb`](https://github.com/vispy/jupyter_rfb)\
:heavy_check_mark: `PyQt` and `PySide`\
:heavy_check_mark: `glfw`\
:heavy_check_mark: `wxPython`

**Notes:**\
:heavy_check_mark: You can use a non-blocking `glfw` canvas from a notebook, as long as you're working locally or have a way to forward the remote graphical desktop (such as X11 forwarding).\
:grey_exclamation: We do not officially support `jupyter notebook` through `jupyter_rfb`, this may change with notebook v7\
:disappointed: [`jupyter_rfb`](https://github.com/vispy/jupyter_rfb) does not work in collab, for a detailed discussion see: https://github.com/vispy/jupyter_rfb/issues/57 

> **Note**
> 
> `fastplotlib` is currently in the **early alpha stage with breaking changes every ~week**, but you're welcome to try it out or contribute! See our [Roadmap for 2023](https://github.com/kushalkolar/fastplotlib/issues/55).

# Documentation

http://fastplotlib.readthedocs.io/ 

The docs are not entirely thorough, we recommend the example notebooks to get started.

Questions, ideas? Post an issue or [chat on gitter](https://gitter.im/fastplotlib/community?utm_source=share-link&utm_medium=link&utm_campaign=share-link).

# Installation

Install using `pip`.

### Minimal, use with your own `Qt` or `glfw` applications
```bash
pip install fastplotlib
```

### Notebook
```bash
pip install "fastplotlib[notebook]"
```

**Optional: install `simplejpeg` for much faster notebook visualization, you will need C compilers and [libjpeg-turbo](https://libjpeg-turbo.org/) to install it:**

```bash
pip install simplejpeg
```

> **Note**
>
> `fastplotlib` and `pygfx` are fast evolving projects, the version available through pip might be outdated, you will need to follow the "For developers" instructions below if you want the latest features. You can find the release history on pypi here: https://pypi.org/project/fastplotlib/#history

### For developers
```bash
git clone https://github.com/kushalkolar/fastplotlib.git
cd fastplotlib

# install all extras in place
pip install -e ".[notebook,docs,tests]"
```

# Examples

> **Note**
> 
> `fastplotlib` and `pygfx` are fast evolving, you may require the latest `pygfx` and `fastplotlib` from github to use the examples in the master branch.

First clone or download the repo to try the examples

```bash
git clone https://github.com/kushalkolar/fastplotlib.git
```

### Desktop examples using `glfw` or `Qt`

```bash
# most dirs within examples contain example code
cd examples/desktop

# simplest example
python image/image_simple.py
```

### Notebook examples

```bash
cd examples/notebooks
jupyter lab
```

**Start out with `simple.ipynb`.**

### Simple image plot
```python
import fastplotlib as fpl
import numpy as np

plot = fpl.Plot()

data = np.random.rand(512, 512)
plot.add_image(data=data)

plot.show()
```

### Fast animations
```python
import fastplotlib as fpl
import numpy as np

plot = fpl.Plot()

data = np.random.rand(512, 512)
image = plot.image(data=data)

def update_data():
    new_data = np.random.rand(512, 512)
    image.data = new_data

plot.add_animations(update_data)

plot.show()
```

### Image widget

Interactive visualization of large imaging datasets in the notebook.

## Graphics drivers

You will need a relatively modern GPU (newer integrated GPUs in CPUs are usually fine). Generally if your GPU is from 2017 or later it should be fine.

For more information see: https://wgpu-py.readthedocs.io/en/stable/start.html#platform-requirements

### Windows:
Vulkan drivers should be installed by default on Windows 11, but you will need to install your GPU manufacturer's driver package (Nvidia or AMD). If you have an integrated GPU within your CPU, you might still need to install a driver package too, check your CPU manufacturer's info.

We also recommend installing C compilers so that you can install `simplejpeg` which improves remote frame buffer performance in notebooks.

### Linux:
Debian based distros:

```bash
sudo apt install mesa-vulkan-drivers
# for better performance with the remote frame buffer install libjpeg-turbo
sudo apt install libjpeg-turbo
```

For other distros install the appropriate vulkan driver package, and optionally the corresponding `libjpeg-turbo` package for better remote-frame-buffer performance in jupyter notebooks.

#### CPU/software rendering (Lavapipe)

If you do not have a GPU you can perform limited software rendering using lavapipe. This should get you everything you need for that on Debian or Ubuntu based distros:

```bash
sudo apt install llvm-dev libturbojpeg* libgl1-mesa-dev libgl1-mesa-glx libglapi-mesa libglx-mesa0 mesa-common-dev mesa-vulkan-drivers
```

### Mac OSX:
As far as I know, WGPU uses Metal instead of Vulkan on Mac. You will need at least Mac OSX 10.13.
