Developer Notes
***************

Welcome to the Developer Notes for `fastplotlib`. These notes aim to provide detailed and technical information
about the various modules, classes, and functions that make up this library, as well as guidelines on how to write
code that integrates nicely with our package. They are intended to help current and future developers understand
the design decisions, and functioning of the library.

Intended Audience
-----------------

These notes are primarily intended for the following groups:

- **Current Developers**: The Developer Notes can serve as a comprehensive guide to understanding the library, making it easier to debug, modify and maintain the code.

- **Future Developers**: These notes can help onboard new developers to the project, providing them with detailed explanations of the codebase and its underlying architecture.

- **Contributors**: If you wish to contribute to the `fastplotlib` project, the Developer Notes can provide a solid foundation of understanding, helping to ensure that your contributions align with the existing structure and design principles of the library.

- **Advanced Users**: While the primary focus of these notes is on development, they might also be of interest to advanced users who want a deeper understanding of the library's functionality.

Please note that these notes assume a certain level of programming knowledge. Familiarity with Python, object-oriented programming, and the NumPy and pygfx libraries would be beneficial when reading these notes.
