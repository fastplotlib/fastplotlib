- If you use ``conda``, you can get ``libjpeg-turbo`` through conda.
- If you are on linux you can get it through your distro's package manager.
- For Windows and Mac compiled binaries are available on their release page: https://github.com/libjpeg-turbo/libjpeg-turbo/releases

Once you have ``libjpeg-turbo``:

.. code-block::

    pip install simplejpeg

What is ``fastplotlib``?
------------------------

``fastplotlib`` is a cutting-edge plotting library built using the `pygfx <https://github.com/pygfx/pygfx>`_ rendering engine.
The lower-level details of the rendering process (i.e. defining a scene, camera, renderer, etc.) are abstracted away, allowing users to focus on their data.
The fundamental goal of ``fastplotlib`` is to provide a high-level, expressive API that promotes large-scale explorative scientific visualization. We want to
make it easy and intuitive to produce interactive visualizations that are as performant and vibrant as a modern video game ðŸ˜„


How to use ``fastplotlib``
--------------------------

Before giving a detailed overview of the library, here is a minimal example::

    import fastplotlib as fpl
    import imageio.v3 as iio

    # create a `Figure`
    fig = fpl.Figure()

    # read data
    data = iio.imread("imageio:astronaut.png")

    # add image graphic
    image_graphic = fig[0, 0].add_image(data=data)

    # show the plot
    fig.show()

    if __name__ == "__main__":
        fpl.run()

.. image:: ../_static/guide_hello_world.png


This is just a simple example of how the ``fastplotlib`` API works to create a plot, add some image data to the plot, and then visualize it.
However, we are just scratching the surface of what is possible with ``fastplotlib``.
Next, let's take a look at the building blocks of ``fastplotlib`` and how they can be used to create more complex visualizations.

Figure
------

The starting point for creating any visualization in ``fastplotlib`` is a ``Figure`` object. This can be a single plot or a grid of subplots.
The ``Figure`` object houses and takes care of the underlying rendering components such as the camera, controller, renderer, and canvas.
Most users won't need to use these directly; however, the ability to directly interact with the rendering engine is still available if
needed.

By default, if no ``shape`` argument is provided when creating a ``Figure``, there will be a single subplot. All subplots in a ``Figure`` can be accessed using
indexing (i.e. ``fig_object[i ,j]``).

After defining a ``Figure``, we can begin to add ``Graphic`` objects.

Graphics
--------

A ``Graphic`` can be an image, a line, a scatter, a collection of lines, and more. All graphics can also be given a convenient ``name``. This allows graphics
to be easily accessed from figures::

    # create a `Figure`
    fig = fpl.Figure()

    # read data
    data = iio.imread("imageio:astronaut.png")

    add image graphic
    image_graphic = fig[0, 0].add_image(data=data, name="astronaut")

    # show plot
    fig.show()

    # index plot to get graphic
    fig[0, 0]["astronaut"]

..

See the examples gallery for examples on how to create and interactive with all the various types of graphics.

Graphics also have mutable properties that can be linked to events. Some of these properties, such as the ``data`` or ``colors`` of a line can even be indexed,
allowing for the creation of very powerful visualizations.

Using our example from above: once we add a ``Graphic`` to the figure, we can then begin to change its properties. ::

    image_graphic.vmax = 150

.. image:: ../_static/guide_hello_world_vmax.png

``Graphic`` properties also support numpy-like slicing for getting and setting data. For example ::

    # basic numpy-like slicing, set the top right corner
    image_graphic.data[:150, -150:] = 0

.. image:: ../_static/guide_hello_world_simple_slicing.png

Fancy indexing is also supported! ::

    bool_array = np.random.choice([True, False], size=(512, 512), p=[0.1, 0.9])
    image_graphic.data[bool_array] = 254

.. image:: ../_static/guide_hello_world_fancy_slicing.png


Selectors
---------

A primary feature of ``fastplotlib`` is the ability to easily interact with your data. Two extremely helpful tools that can
be used in order to facilitate this process are a ``LinearSelector`` and ``LinearRegionSelector``.

A ``LinearSelector`` is a horizontal or vertical line slider. This tool allows you to very easily select different points in your
data. Let's look at an example: ::

    import fastplotlib as fpl
    import numpy as np

    # generate data
    xs = np.linspace(-10, 10, 100)
    ys = np.sin(xs)
    sine = np.column_stack([xs, ys])

    fig = fpl.Figure()

    sine_graphic = fig[0, 0].add_line(data=sine, colors="w")

    # add a linear selector the sine wave
    selector = sine_graphic.add_linear_selector()

    fig.show(maintain_aspect=False)

.. image:: ../_static/guide_linear_selector.webp


A ``LinearRegionSelector`` is very similar to a ``LinearSelector`` but as opposed to selecting a singular point of
your data, you are able to select an entire region.

See the examples gallery for more in-depth examples with selector tools.

Now we have the basics of creating a ``Figure``, adding ``Graphics`` to a ``Figure``, and working with ``Graphic`` properties to dynamically change or alter them.
Let's take a look at how we can define events to link ``Graphics`` and their properties together.

Events
------

Events can be a multitude of things: traditional events such as mouse or keyboard events, or events related to ``Graphic`` properties.

There are two ways to add events in ``fastplotlib``.

1) Use the method `add_event_handler()` ::

    def event_handler(ev):
        pass

    graphic.add_event_handler(event_handler, "event_type")

..


2) or a decorator ::

    @graphic.add_event_handler("event_type")
    def event_handler(ev):
        pass

..


The ``event_handler`` is a user-defined function that accepts an event instance as the first and only positional argument.
Information about the structure of event instances are described below. The ``"event_type"``
is a string that identifies the type of event; this can be either a ``pygfx.Event`` or a ``Graphic`` property event.

``graphic.supported_events`` will return a tuple of all ``event_type`` strings that this graphic supports.

When an event occurs, the user-defined event handler will receive an event object. Depending on the type of event, the
event object will have relevant information that can be used in the callback. See below for event tables.

Graphic property events
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

All ``Graphic`` events have the following attributes:

    +------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------+
    | attribute  | type        | description                                   |
    +============+=============+===============================================+
    | type       | str         | "colors" - name of the event                  |
    +------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------+
    | graphic    | Graphic     | graphic instance that the event is from       |
    +------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------+
    | info       | dict        | event info dictionary                         |
    +------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------+
    | target     | WorldObject | pygfx rendering engine object for the graphic |
    +------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------+
    | time_stamp | float       | time when the event occurred, in ms           |
    +------------+-------------+-----------------------------------------------+

The ``info`` attribute will house additional information for different ``Graphic`` property events:

Rendering engine events from a Graphic
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Rendering engine event handlers can be added to a graphic or to a Figure (see next section).
Here is a description of all rendering engine events and their attributes.

* **pointer_down**: emitted when the user interacts with mouse,
  touch or other pointer devices, by pressing it down.

    * *x*: horizontal position of the pointer within the widget.
    * *y*: vertical position of the pointer within the widget.
    * *button*: the button to which this event applies. See "Mouse buttons" section below for details.
    * *buttons*: a tuple of buttons being pressed down.
    * *modifiers*: a tuple of modifier keys being pressed down. See section below for details.
    * *ntouches*: the number of simultaneous pointers being down.
    * *touches*: a dict with int keys (pointer id's), and values that are dicts
      that contain "x", "y", and "pressure".
    * *time_stamp*: a timestamp in seconds.

* **pointer_up**: emitted when the user releases a pointer.
  This event has the same keys as the pointer down event.

* **pointer_move**: emitted when the user moves a pointer.
  This event has the same keys as the pointer down event.
  This event is throttled.

* **double_click**: emitted on a double-click.
  This event looks like a pointer event, but without the touches.

* **wheel**: emitted when the mouse-wheel is used (scrolling),
  or when scrolling/pinching on the touchpad/touchscreen.

  Similar to the JS wheel event, the values of the deltas depend on the
  platform and whether the mouse-wheel, trackpad or a touch-gesture is
  used. Also, scrolling can be linear or have inertia. As a rule of
  thumb, one "wheel action" results in a cumulative ``dy`` of around
  100. Positive values of ``dy`` are associated with scrolling down and
  zooming out. Positive values of ``dx`` are associated with scrolling
  to the right. (A note for Qt users: the sign of the deltas is (usually)
  reversed compared to the QWheelEvent.)

  On MacOS, using the mouse-wheel while holding shift results in horizontal
  scrolling. In applications where the scroll dimension does not matter,
  it is therefore recommended to use `delta = event['dy'] or event['dx']`.

    * *dx*: the horizontal scroll delta (positive means scroll right).
    * *dy*: the vertical scroll delta (positive means scroll down or zoom out).
    * *x*: the mouse horizontal position during the scroll.
    * *y*: the mouse vertical position during the scroll.
    * *buttons*: a tuple of buttons being pressed down.
    * *modifiers*: a tuple of modifier keys being pressed down.
    * *time_stamp*: a timestamp in seconds.

* **key_down**: emitted when a key is pressed down.

    * *key*: the key being pressed as a string. See section below for details.
    * *modifiers*: a tuple of modifier keys being pressed down.
    * *time_stamp*: a timestamp in seconds.

* **key_up**: emitted when a key is released.
  This event has the same keys as the key down event.


Time stamps
~~~~~~~~~~~

Since the time origin of ``time_stamp`` values is undefined,
time stamp values only make sense in relation to other time stamps.


Mouse buttons
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* 0: No button.
* 1: Left button.
* 2: Right button.
* 3: Middle button
* 4-9: etc.


Keys
~~~~

The key names follow the `browser spec <https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/KeyboardEvent>`_.

* Keys that represent a character are simply denoted as such. For these the case matters:
  "a", "A", "z", "Z" "3", "7", "&", " " (space), etc.
* The modifier keys are:
  "Shift", "Control", "Alt", "Meta".
* Some example keys that do not represent a character:
  "ArrowDown", "ArrowUp", "ArrowLeft", "ArrowRight", "F1", "Backspace", etc.


Add renderer event handlers to a Figure
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

You can add event handlers to a ``Figure`` object's renderer. For example, this is useful for defining click events
where you want to map click positions to the nearest graphic object. See the previous section for a description
of all the renderer events.

Renderer event handlers can be added using a method or a decorator.

For example: ::

    import fastplotlib as fpl
    import numpy as np

    # generate some circles
    def make_circle(center, radius: float, n_points: int = 75) -> np.ndarray:
        theta = np.linspace(0, 2 * np.pi, n_points)
        xs = radius * np.sin(theta)
        ys = radius * np.cos(theta)

        return np.column_stack([xs, ys]) + center

    # this makes 5 circles, so we can create 5 cmap values, so it will use these values to set the
    # color of the line based by using the cmap as a LUT with the corresponding cmap_value
    circles = list()
    for x in range(0, 50, 10):
        circles.append(make_circle(center=(x, 0), radius=4, n_points=100))

    # create figure
    fig = fpl.Figure()

    # add circles to plot
    circles_graphic = fig[0,0].add_line_collection(data=circles, cmap="tab10", thickness=10)

ImageWidget
-----------

Often times, developing UIs for interacting with multi-dimension image data can be tedious and repetitive.
In order to aid with common image and video visualization requirements the ``ImageWidget`` automatically generates sliders
to easily navigate through different dimensions of your data. The image widget supports 2D, 3D and 4D arrays.

Let's look at an example: ::

    import fastplotlib as fpl
    import imageio.v3 as iio

    movie = iio.imread("imageio:cockatoo.mp4")

    # convert RGB movie to grayscale
    gray_movie = np.dot(movie[..., :3], [0.299, 0.587, 0.114])

    iw_movie = ImageWidget(
    data=gray_movie,
    cmap="gray"
    )

    iw_movie.show()

.. image:: ../_static/guide_image_widget.webp

Animations
----------

An animation function is a user-defined function that gets called on every rendering cycle. Let's look at an example: ::

    import fastplotlib as fpl
    import numpy as np

    # generate some data
    start, stop = 0, 2 * np.pi
    increment = (2 * np.pi) / 50

    # make a simple sine wave
    xs = np.linspace(start, stop, 100)
    ys = np.sin(xs)

    figure = fpl.Figure(size=(700, 560))

    # plot the image data
    sine = figure[0, 0].add_line(ys, name="sine", colors="r")


    # increment along the x-axis on each render loop :D
    def update_line(subplot):
        global increment, start, stop
        xs = np.linspace(start + increment, stop + increment, 100)
        ys = np.sin(xs)

        start += increment
        stop += increment

        # change only the y-axis values of the line
        subplot["sine"].data[:, 1] = ys


    figure[0, 0].add_animations(update_line)

    figure.show(maintain_aspect=False)

.. image:: ../_static/guide_animation.webp

Here we are defining a function that updates the data of the ``LineGraphic`` in the plot with new data. When adding an animation function, the
user-defined function will receive a subplot instance as an argument when it is called.

Spaces
------

There are several spaces to consider when using ``fastplotlib``:

1) World Space

    World space is the 3D space in which graphical objects live. Objects
    and the camera can exist anywhere in this space.

2) Data Space

    Data space is simply the world space plus any offset or rotation that has been applied to an object.

.. note::
    World space does not always correspond directly to data space, you may have to adjust for any offset or rotation of the ``Graphic``.

3) Screen Space

    Screen space is the 2D space in which your screen pixels reside. This space is constrained by the screen width and height in pixels.
    In the rendering process, the camera is responsible for projecting the world space into screen space.

.. note::
    When interacting with ``Graphic`` objects, there is a very helpful function for mapping screen space to world space
    (``Figure.map_screen_to_world(pos=(x, y))``). This can be particularly useful when working with click events where click
    positions are returned in screen space but ``Graphic`` objects that you may want to interact with exist in world
    space.

For more information on the various spaces used by rendering engines please see this `article <https://learnopengl.com/Getting-started/Coordinate-Systems>`_

Imgui
-----

Fastplotlib uses `imgui_bundle <https://github.com/pthom/imgui_bundle>`_ to provide within-canvas UI elemenents if you
installed ``fastplotlib`` using the ``imgui`` toggle, i.e. ``fastplotlib[imgui]``, or installed ``imgui_bundle`` afterwards.

Fastplotlib comes built-in with imgui UIs for subplot toolbars and a standard right-click menu with a number of options.
You can also make custom GUIs and embed them within the canvas, see the examples gallery for detailed examples.

.. note::
    Imgui is optional, you can use other GUI frameworks such at Qt or ipywidgets with fastplotlib. You can also of course
    use imgui and Qt or ipywidgets.

Using ``fastplotlib`` in an interactive shell
---------------------------------------------

There are multiple ways to use ``fastplotlib`` in interactive shells, such as ipython.

1) Jupyter

On ``jupyter lab`` the jupyter backend (i.e. ``jupyter_rfb``) is normally selected. This works via
client-server rendering. Images generated on the server are streamed to the client (Jupyter) via a jpeg byte stream.
Events (such as mouse or keyboard events) are then streamed in the opposite direction prompting new images to be generated
by the server if necessary. This remote-frame-buffer approach makes the rendering process very fast. ``fastplotlib`` viusalizations
can be displayed in cell output or on the side using ``sidecar``.

A Qt backend can also optionally be used as well. If ``%gui qt`` is selected before importing ``fastplotlib`` then this backend
will be used instead.

Lastly, users can also force using ``glfw`` by specifying this as an argument when instantiating a ``Figure`` (i.e. ``Figure(canvas="gflw"``).

.. note::
    Do not mix between gui backends. For example, if you start the notebook using Qt, do not attempt to force using another backend such
    as ``jupyter_rfb`` later.

2) IPython

Users can select between using a Qt backend or gflw using the same methods as above.
