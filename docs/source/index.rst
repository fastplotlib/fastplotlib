Summary
=======

Next-gen plotting library built using the `pygfx <https://github.com/pygfx/pygfx>`_ render engine utilizing
`Vulkan <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vulkan>`_, `DX12 <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DirectX#DirectX_12>`_, or
`Metal <https://developer.apple.com/metal/>`_ via `WGPU <https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu-native>`_, so it is very fast!
``fastplotlib`` is an expressive plotting library that enables rapid prototyping for large scale exploratory scientific
visualization. ``fastplotlib`` will run on any framework that ``pygfx`` runs on, this includes ``glfw``, ``Qt``
and ``jupyter lab``
