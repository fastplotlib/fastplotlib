        Start a recording, experimental. Call ``record_end()`` to end a recording.

        Requires PyAV: https://github.com/PyAV-Org/PyAV

        **Do not resize canvas during a recording, the width and height must remain constant!**

        Parameters
        ----------
        path: str or Path
            path to save the recording

        fps: int, default ``25``
            framerate, do not use > 25 within jupyter

        codec: str, default "mpeg4"
            codec to use, see ``ffmpeg`` list: https://www.ffmpeg.org/ffmpeg-codecs.html .
            In general, ``"mpeg4"`` should work on most systems. ``"libx264"`` is a
            better option if you have it installed.

        pixel_format: str, default "yuv420p"
            pixel format

        options: dict, optional
            Codec options. For example, if using ``"mpeg4"`` you can use ``{"q:v": "20"}`` to set the quality between
            1-31, where "1" is highest and "31" is lowest. If using ``"libx264"``` you can use ``{"crf": "30"}`` where
            the "crf" value is between "0" (highest quality) and "50" (lowest quality). See ``ffmpeg`` docs for more
            info on codec options

        Examples
        --------

        With ``"mpeg4"``

        .. code-block:: python

            # end recording
